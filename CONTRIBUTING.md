Contributing would be great as myself and Raghavan are the developer for this bot.

You can help contribute by:

Translation language files (help with previous translations or make support for another language)
Optimization on files. (Know a better way on a function, make a pull request and I'll have a look)
Donating (Donating helps me stay motivated to providing open source code, that anyone can use)
Bringing up new ideas and new commands (yeah for sure we need'em)
